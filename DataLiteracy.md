- Mean, median, and mode
- Variability measures: range, variance, standard deviation
- Skewness and kurtosis

::: notes
**Mean, Median, and Mode**: These are measures of central tendency used to describe the average or typical value of a dataset. The mean is the arithmetic average, the median is the middle value when the data is sorted, and the mode is the most frequently occurring value.

**Variability Measures**: Range, variance, and standard deviation are measures of dispersion that indicate the spread or variability of data points around the central tendency. They provide insights into the degree of dispersion or concentration of data values.

**Skewness and Kurtosis**: Skewness measures the asymmetry of the data distribution, indicating whether the data is skewed to the left or right. Kurtosis measures the peakedness or flatness of the distribution, indicating whether the data has heavy tails or is sharply peaked.

- Scatter plots
- Pie charts

::: notes
**Histograms**: Histograms are graphical representations of the distribution of numerical data. They display the frequency or count of data points within predefined intervals, providing insights into the shape and spread of the data distribution.

**Box Plots**: Box plots, also known as box-and-whisker plots, summarize the distribution of numerical data using quartiles. They show the median, quartiles, and potential outliers in the dataset, making them useful for comparing distributions and identifying outliers.

**Scatter Plots**: Scatter plots visualize the relationship between two numerical variables. Each data point is represented as a dot on the plot, allowing for the identification of patterns, trends, and relationships between variables.

**Pie Charts**: Pie charts are circular visualizations that represent the proportions of different categories within a dataset. They are useful for showing the composition of a whole and comparing the relative sizes of different categories.

## Understanding Diagnostic Analytics

- Definition and purpose of diagnostic analytics
- Contrasting with descriptive analytics
- Identifying causal relationships

::: notes
**Definition and Purpose of Diagnostic Analytics**: Diagnostic analytics involves digging deeper into data to understand why certain events occurred. It focuses on identifying causal relationships and root causes behind observed patterns or trends in the data.

**Contrasting with Descriptive Analytics**: While descriptive analytics summarizes historical data to describe what happened, diagnostic analytics goes further to determine why it happened. It aims to uncover insights into the underlying factors driving observed outcomes.

**Identifying Causal Relationships**: Diagnostic analytics seeks to identify causal relationships between variables or events. This involves examining correlations, conducting statistical tests, and exploring potential cause-and-effect relationships to gain a deeper understanding of the data.
:::

## Techniques for Diagnostic Analysis

- Correlation analysis
- Regression analysis
- Hypothesis testing
- Root cause analysis

::: notes
**Correlation Analysis**: Correlation analysis measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two or more variables. It helps identify associations and dependencies between variables, but does not imply causation.

**Regression Analysis**: Regression analysis examines the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It helps quantify the impact of independent variables on the dependent variable and identify predictors of the outcome.

**Hypothesis Testing**: Hypothesis testing is used to determine whether observed differences or relationships in data are statistically significant or occurred by chance. It involves formulating a null hypothesis and conducting statistical tests to evaluate its validity.

**Root Cause Analysis**: Root cause analysis aims to identify the underlying causes or factors contributing to observed outcomes or problems. It involves systematically investigating potential causes, assessing their impact, and identifying actionable solutions to address root causes.
:::

## Interpreting Diagnostic Results

- Assessing statistical significance
- Understanding correlation vs. causation
- Evaluating model performance
- Drawing actionable insights

::: notes
**Assessing Statistical Significance**: In diagnostic analytics, it is essential to assess the statistical significance of findings to determine whether observed relationships or differences are meaningful. Statistical tests help quantify the likelihood that observed results occurred by chance.

**Understanding Correlation vs. Causation**: While correlation measures the degree of association between variables, causation implies a direct cause-and-effect relationship. It's important to distinguish between correlation and causation to avoid making erroneous conclusions.

**Evaluating Model Performance**: When using regression or predictive models in diagnostic analytics, it's crucial to evaluate their performance metrics, such as R-squared, p-values, and error rates. Model validation ensures that the model accurately captures relationships in the data and can generalize to new observations.

**Drawing Actionable Insights**: The ultimate goal of diagnostic analytics is to derive actionable insights that inform decision-making and drive improvements. Insights should be actionable, relevant, and supported by evidence from the diagnostic analysis.
:::
