## The Importance of Data Literacy
- Understanding data's role
- Enhancing decision quality
- Balancing data and intuition


:::notes
- Understanding data's role
Data informed decision-making is an approach where data is used to inform decisions but not solely drive them, allowing for inclusion of other factors such as human intuition and experience.

- Enhancing decision quality
The term became particularly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic. This approach leverages various aspects of data literacy, including the understanding of data's characteristics, analytics levels, and communication techniques.

- Balancing data and intuition
To be data driven means many things to many people, but ultimately it means data is strongly being used as an asset for an individual or organization. Think of it as a marathon runner using a plan to drive a strategy for a successful marathon.

## Steps of the Framework
- Ask
- Acquire
- Analyze

:::notes
- Ask
The first step involves asking the right questions to understand what decisions need to be made and what data is required to make those decisions.

- Acquire
The second step focuses on acquiring the data that is relevant to the questions posed. This involves identifying the right sources of data and collecting it effectively.

- Analyze
The third step involves analyzing the collected data to extract insights that will inform decision-making. This could involve various analytical techniques depending on the complexity of the data and the decisions at hand.
:::

## Step 1: Ask
- Formulate questions
- Define objectives
- Identify goals


:::notes
- Formulate questions
Formulating the right questions is crucial as it sets the direction for what information needs to be gathered.

- Define objectives
Defining clear objectives helps in focusing the data acquisition process and ensures that the data collected is relevant.

- Identify goals
Identifying the overarching goals of the decision-making process ensures that the analysis is aligned with the strategic objectives of the organization.
:::

## Step 2: Acquire
- Collect data
- Source information
- Gather relevant data


:::notes
- Collect data
Data collection should be targeted to address the questions formulated in the first step. It involves identifying and utilizing various data sources.

- Source information
Sourcing the right information is critical to ensure the quality and relevance of the data collected.

- Gather relevant data
Gathering relevant data involves filtering out unnecessary information and focusing on data that directly contributes to decision-making.
:::

## Step 3: Analyze
- Interpret data
- Find patterns
- Extract insights

:::notes
- Interpret data
Data interpretation involves converting raw data into information that can be understood and used to make decisions.

- Find patterns
Finding patterns in the data can help predict future trends and make more informed decisions.

- Extract insights
Extracting insights from data involves using analytical tools and techniques to delve deeper into the data and understand the underlying causes and implications.
:::

## Step 4: Integrate
- Synthesize information
- Combine insights
- Develop solutions

:::notes
- Synthesize information
Integrating different pieces of information to form a coherent understanding is essential for making informed decisions.

- Combine insights
Combining insights from different data analyses can provide a more comprehensive view of the situation and better decision-making support.

- Develop solutions
Developing solutions involves using the insights gained to formulate actionable strategies that address the objectives defined earlier.
:::

## Step 5: Decide
- Make choices
- Based on data
- Informed decisions

:::notes
- Make choices
Making choices involves selecting the best course of action based on the analyzed data and the integrated insights.

- Based on data
Decisions should be grounded in data to ensure they are objective and justifiable.

- Informed decisions
Informed decisions are those that are made using a combination of data, insights, and managerial judgment.
:::

## Step 6: Iterate
- Review process
- Continuous improvement
- Adjust strategies

:::notes
- Review process
Reviewing the decision-making process regularly to identify areas for improvement.

- Continuous improvement
Continuous improvement involves refining the decision-making process based on feedback and changing circumstances.

- Adjust strategies
Adjusting strategies as needed based on the outcomes of decisions and new information.
