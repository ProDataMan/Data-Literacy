## Slide 1: Introduction to Data Informed Decision-Making Framework

- Six essential steps.
- Different frameworks exist.
- Incorporate these steps.

:::notes
The data informed decision-making framework we are employing for this book has six steps. Please note, there are different frameworks that exist in the world for making a decision, but for a strong decision-making framework to be deployed and used correctly, these six steps need to be incorporated in some way, shape, or form. The six steps are: ask, acquire, analyze, apply, announce, and assess.

## Slide 2: Modification of the Framework

- Modified for clarity.
- Renamed steps.
- Enhance understanding.

:::notes
I am going to modify these from Kevinâ€™s work a bit and name them: ask, acquire, analyze, integrate, decide, and iterate. The reason for the shift is to clarify more, directed at each purpose and understanding.

## Slide 3: Infinite Design and Learning

- Framework's infinite design.
- Continuous learning.
- Decision-making not guaranteed.

:::notes
Do you notice something about this framework? It is infinite in its design. This is part of the design of data informed decision-making. As we roll through the process of working towards insight and a data informed decision, we must know that nothing is guaranteed with decision-making. This is part of the beauty of a strong data informed decision-making framework: we have the ability to iterate and learn from the past decisions. We never want to sit back and rest on our laurels with our decisions. We want to use our framework and our data literacy skills to improve upon our decisions and help them become even better. Statistics is a field of probabilities and sometimes probabilities do not go the way we want. That is ok, we learn from our decisions, the process, and more.
:::

## Slide 4: Iterative Process

- Ability to iterate and learn.
- Improve decisions.
- Statistics is a field of probabilities.

:::notes
To help us understand the framework more, let us jump in and understand each step in more detail. Herein we will dive into the different angles of data literacy and how these angles help empower data informed decision-making.
