## Slide 1: Steps of the Data Informed Decision-Making Framework

- The data informed decision-making framework consists of six essential steps.
- These steps are crucial for making informed and effective decisions.
- Let's explore each step in detail to understand its significance in the decision-making process.

---

## Slide 2: Framework Overview

- The six steps of the framework are: ask, acquire, analyze, integrate, decide, and iterate.
- We've modified these steps slightly to enhance clarity and purpose: ask, acquire, analyze, integrate, decide, and iterate.
- This framework is designed to provide direction and understanding throughout the decision-making process.

---

## Slide 3: Infinite Design

- The framework's design is infinite, allowing for continuous improvement and learning.
- Decision-making is not guaranteed, but the framework enables iteration and learning from past decisions.
- Our goal is to constantly improve decisions using our data literacy skills and framework.

---

## Slide 4: Understanding the Framework

- Let's delve into each step of the framework to gain a deeper understanding.
- Each step plays a crucial role in empowering data informed decision-making.
- We'll explore the various facets of data literacy and how they contribute to each step.

---

## Slide 5: Ask

- The first step is to ask pertinent questions that guide the decision-making process.
- Effective questioning ensures clarity and focus on the desired outcomes.
- Asking the right questions is fundamental to initiating the decision-making journey.

---

## Slide 6: Acquire

- Acquiring relevant data is essential for informed decision-making.
- This step involves gathering data from various sources to inform the analysis process.
- Data acquisition lays the foundation for subsequent steps in the framework.

---

## Slide 7: Analyze

- Analysis involves examining the acquired data to derive insights and patterns.
- Data analysis techniques help uncover meaningful information to support decision-making.
- Analytical skills are crucial for interpreting data accurately and effectively.

---

## Slide 8: Integrate

- Integrating insights from data analysis into the decision-making process is imperative.
- This step involves synthesizing information to form a comprehensive understanding.
- Integration ensures that data-driven insights are incorporated into decision-making effectively.

---

## Slide 9: Decide

- Decision-making involves evaluating options based on integrated insights and making informed choices.
- Deciding requires weighing factors, risks, and benefits to determine the best course of action.
- Effective decision-making is guided by data-informed insights and objectives.

---

## Slide 10: Iterate

- Iteration is essential for refining decisions and improving outcomes over time.
- Learning from past decisions and experiences enables continuous improvement.
- Iterative processes enhance the effectiveness of decision-making and drive progress.

---

## Slide 11: Chapter Summary and Example

- To conclude the chapter, we'll summarize the key concepts discussed.
- We'll illustrate the data informed decision-making framework using a real-world example.
- Understanding this framework empowers individuals and organizations to make informed decisions effectively.
