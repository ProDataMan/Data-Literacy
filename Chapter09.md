:::

# Slide 5: Ask

- Importance of asking questions.

:::notes
- Asking relevant questions is fundamental to initiating the decision-making journey.
- Effective questioning ensures clarity and alignment with desired outcomes.
- The "Ask" step sets the foundation for the entire decision-making process by defining the problem or objective.
:::

# Slide 6: Acquire

- Significance of acquiring relevant data.

:::notes
- Acquiring relevant data is essential for informed decision-making.
- This step involves gathering data from diverse sources to inform the analysis process.
- Data acquisition lays the foundation for subsequent steps in the decision-making framework.
:::

# Slide 7: Analyze

- Importance of data analysis.

:::notes
- Data analysis techniques are crucial for extracting insights from the acquired data.
- Analytical skills enable individuals to interpret data accurately and derive meaningful conclusions.
- Analysis helps uncover patterns and trends that inform decision-making.

# Slide 8: Integrate

- Role of integration.

:::notes
- Integration involves synthesizing insights from data analysis to form a comprehensive understanding.
- This step ensures that data-driven insights are effectively incorporated into the decision-making process.
- Integrating insights from various sources enhances the robustness of decision-making.
:::

# Slide 9: Decide

- Evaluating options.

:::notes
- Decision-making involves evaluating options based on integrated insights and considering various factors, risks, and benefits.
- It is essential to weigh these factors to make informed choices that align with organizational objectives.
- The "Decide" step determines the best course of action based on the analysis and integration of data-driven insights.
:::

# Slide 10: Iterate

- Significance of iteration.

:::notes
