## Slide 1: Introduction to Data Informed Decision-Making Framework

- Six essential steps.
- Different frameworks exist.
- Incorporate these steps.

:::notes
The data informed decision-making framework we are employing for this book has six steps. Different frameworks exist, but for a strong decision-making framework to be deployed and used correctly, these six steps need to be incorporated in some way, shape, or form.
:::

## Slide 2: Modification of the Framework

- Modified for clarity.
- Renamed steps.
- Enhance understanding.

:::notes
The steps are modified from Kevinâ€™s work for clarity and purpose. Renamed as ask, acquire, analyze, integrate, decide, and iterate. The modification aims to clarify each step's purpose and understanding.

## Slide 3: Infinite Design and Learning

- Framework's infinite design.
- Continuous learning.
- Decision-making not guaranteed.

:::notes
The framework's design is infinite, facilitating continuous learning and adaptation. Decision-making is not guaranteed, but the framework enables continuous improvement through reflection and learning.
:::

## Slide 4: Iterative Process

- Ability to iterate and learn.
- Improve decisions.
- Statistics is a field of probabilities.

:::notes
We have the ability to iterate and learn from past decisions. The goal is to improve upon our decisions and make them even better. Statistics is a field of probabilities, and we learn from our decisions and the process.
:::

## Slide 5: Understanding Each Step

- Dive into each step.
- Explore data literacy.
- Empower decision-making.

:::notes
Let's dive into each step in more detail and explore different angles of data literacy. We'll understand how these angles empower data informed decision-making.
:::

## Slide 6: Conclusion

- Combine insights.
- Summarize key points.
- Highlight importance.

:::notes
To conclude the chapter, we'll combine insights into a full picture of decision-making. We'll summarize the chapter's key points and concepts, emphasizing the importance of data informed decision-making in enhancing decision quality.
