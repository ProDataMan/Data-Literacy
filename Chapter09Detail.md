- Chapter 09: Data Informed Decision-Making
Please note for this book’s purpose we are utilizing the term ‘data informed’ versus ‘data driven’. This is on purpose, but I do concede that in most cases data driven is used in the world today. The term ‘data driven’ really gained steam in the late 2010s and into 2020, and especially moved forward with the onslaught of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. To be data driven means many things to many people, but ultimately it means data is strongly being used as an asset for an individual or organization. Think of it as a marathon runner using a plan to drive a strategy for a successful marathon. This is what data driven or data informed means. It means that data is helping to drive decisions and the business forward. The reason I use the term data informed over data driven is that with the term data driven one can make the mistake in thinking that the data is truly driving everything. Data informed means the data was used to help make the decision, but is combined with other things, like the human element. This distinction matters as it is powerful.
To help us understand data informed decisions and their combination with data literacy, we will be digging into our entire bag of tricks of data literacy. We will start by defining the framework and its power to drive decision-making. We will be looking at the data informed decision-making framework from what may seem like all possible angles: the four characteristics of the definition of data literacy, the four levels of analytics, speaking the language of data, the three Cs of data literacy, and probably more angles. For us to get started here, we need to know the steps of the data informed decision-making framework.

## Introduction to Data-Informed Decision-Making
- Understanding Data-Informed Approaches
- Emphasis on Human Element
- Framework Overview

- Understanding Data-Informed Approaches
Data informed decision-making is an approach where data is used to inform decisions but not solely drive them, allowing for inclusion of other factors such as human intuition and experience.
- Emphasis on Human Element
This approach takes into account that while data can provide valuable insights, it is the human element that interprets and uses the data, ensuring that decisions are not made in a vacuum but are instead informed by a blend of data and human judgment.
- Framework Overview
We explore several aspects of data literacy within the context of data informed decision-making, such as asking the right questions, acquiring relevant data, analyzing data effectively, and applying it to make informed decisions.

## Steps of the Data-Informed Decision-Making Framework
- Ask the Right Questions
- Acquire Relevant Data
- Analyze Data Effectively

:::notes
- Ask the Right Questions
The first step in the data-informed decision-making process involves identifying what you need to know to make a decision and formulating those needs into clear, actionable questions.
- Acquire Relevant Data
Once the questions are defined, the next step is to gather the data that will help answer these questions. This involves both identifying the necessary datasets and ensuring their accessibility.
- Analyze Data Effectively
With the data in hand, the analysis phase involves extracting meaningful insights that can inform decision-making. This step uses various analytical techniques to interpret the data and draw conclusions.

## Detailed Steps Explained
- Step 1: Ask
- Step 2: Acquire
- Step 3: Analyze

:::notes
- Step 1: Ask
Detailing further on the first step, it's crucial to be precise in the questions posed to ensure the data acquired is useful and relevant to the decisions being made.
- Step 2: Acquire
In the acquisition phase, emphasis is placed on the quality of the data gathered, as well as its relevance to the questions posed.
- Step 3: Analyze
The analysis phase is where data is transformed into insights. This involves not just numerical analysis but also contextual interpretation to ensure the insights are applicable to the real-world decisions they are meant to inform.
